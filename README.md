# GestureWave
GestureWave is a Python project that enables real-time control of your computer's volume using hand gestures. By utilizing OpenCV for video capture, MediaPipe for hand tracking, and PyAutoGUI for system control, this project offers an intuitive way to adjust volume through simple finger movements captured via webcam.
